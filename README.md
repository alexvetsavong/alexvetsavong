# Introduction
👋 Hi, I’m @alexvetsavong! I graduated from UIUC with a BSc. in Computer Engineering, specifically focusing on computer architecture and hardware verification.

👀 I’m interested in ... playing video games, computer graphics, computer architectural design and hardware verification, as well as reading comics and creating art in my free time.

🌱 I’m currently learning anything and everything possible related to my undergrad studies, including but not limited to: computer architectural design, data analysis, Machine Learning problems and more!

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything, really. Feel free to reach out, as I'm always willing to learn and study to work on new and exciting projects.
